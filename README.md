# jQuery Data Attribute Search

This jQuery plugin is used to search the data attributes on a page. On Keyup the plugin searches the current DOM for any matching data attributes, searches them for the input, and hides them if they don't match. This plugin was built to provide a quick and easy search function for a very text heavy page.
